# Setfit


Code and textual data to document the "Fine-Tuned SetFit Models for Classifying Sentences from French Novels into Character and Narrator Speech". 

One model is optimized for first-person (autodiegetic, to some extent homodiegetic) narrative, one optimized for third-person (heterodiegetic, to some extent homodiegetic) narrative. 

Performance is around 89% accuracy for the first-person model and 93% for the third-person model.Â 

There is training and evaluation data available. Also, additional plain text data for further annotations is available.
