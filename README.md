# Setfit


Code and textual data to document the "Fine-Tuned SetFit Model for Classifying Sentences from German Novels into Character and Narrator Speech". Originally created for French Novels by Christof Schöch, see https://gitlab.rlp.net/dhtrier/research/setfit 

One model is optimized for third-person (heterodiegetic) narrative. 

Performance is around 89,6% accuracy. 

There is training and evaluation data available. Also, additional plain text data for further annotations is available.
